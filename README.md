<h2>Here are some samples of data visualization I have done previously</h2>
   <p>Any of the files that have the .ipynb extension contain examples of data visualization and the accompanying code. Unfortunately, I could not find any "presentation-ready" figures, so I generated a heat-map in "2008 Basketball Stats.ipynb" to show something more complex that I could throw together quickly.</p>
